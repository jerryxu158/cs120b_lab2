 *	Assignment: Lab 2 Exercise 4(challenge)
 *	Exercise Description: An amusement park kid ride cart has three seats, with 8-bit weight sensors 
 *	connected to ports A, B, and C (measuring from 0-255 kilograms). 
 *	Set PD0 to 1 if the cart's total passenger weight exceeds the maximum of 140 kg. 
 *	Also, the cart must be balanced: Set port PD1 to 1 f the difference between A and C exceeds 80 kg.  
 *	The remaining 6 bits on D should display an approximation of the total combined weight.
 *	Hint: You donâ€™t have enough bits to represent the complete value; you only need to represent the most significant bits. 
 *	Interesting note: Disneyland recently redid their "It's a Small World" ride because the average passenger weight has increased over the years, causing more boats to get stuck on the bottom.
